- 👋 Hi, I’m Idrees Ali 
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps, Cloud, and Containerization  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning security-enhancing technologies for servers and deployments 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Ansible Projects and Kubernetes projects 
- 📫 You can reach me via my Linkedin, mail and  Instagram 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a slow learner but you know there is a saying slow and steady wins the race. My basics and concepts are clear because of my slow learning.
